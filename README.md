2024 Solution Challenge - GDSC KU

## Problems
Many people with disablities have difficulty in communication. However, everyone, regardless of disability, should be able to communicate. This is because having trouble with talking can do more than make daily life tough; it can stop people from being part of society and showing their true worth. Also, it makes it harder to get good medical care for those with disabilities and can make them more likely to be taken advantage of or face other harmful situations.

## Solution
In the frontend, there is a feature that allows users to select word cards directly to complete sentences they wish to express. The AI provides eye-tracking functionality as an alternative input method to keyboard typing or voice recognition. Through eye analysis with camera, the AI identifies the on-screen coordinates the user is focusing on. Then, the frontend places a marker called Looky at these coordinates to indicate where the user is looking.

### Stack
- Flutter
- Tensorflow + Keras

### Prototype

## Expected Effects
The ultimate goal of this project is to facilitate a society where communication is accessible to all, regardless of disability. Our focus has been particularly on those who cannot easily utilize standard communication devices due to disabilities. Through the development of an eye-tracking communication method, we aim to assist them in engaging freely with society.
